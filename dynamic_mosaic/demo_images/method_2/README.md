# Dynamic mosaic (semi-WIP)

method 2 : spawn points everywhere, then iteratively merge some that are too close and/or too similar in color. Works much better than method 1.

I have no rights to the original images nor to these produced ones, and they are by default not available for anyone to use comercially.
