A simple overview of the Artificial Intelligence field and its subfields of Expert Systems, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the recent Foundation Models.

Does not go into details of training paradigms (Supervised etc.), DL architectures (CNN, RNN, Transformers...), tech/coding info, or my own experience or opinions.

Second try recording a video, dit it again in one take and it's still quite far from the quality I'd like these videos to have but I'd say it's passable.

Sources / More reading (still no hyperlinks): 
- The Deep Learning book by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courtville, 2016. All available online so I recommend reading just the introduction, it's not too long and fairly accessible. www.deeplearningbook.org
- The report on Foundation Models by a Stanford group, 2022. Long report so I recommend just the intro, but you can take a look at the table of contents and pick and choose some other parts to read as well (like 3. Applications and 5. Society). https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258
