A simple overview of the Artificial Intelligence field and its subfields of Expert Systems, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the recent Foundation Models. Not too sure about the 1 sec detail thing but I figured it could be a good compromise between too much and not enough, you either wait a bit or pause...

Does not go into details of training paradigms (Supervised etc.), DL architectures (CNN, RNN, Transformers...), tech/coding info, or my own experience or opinions.

Second try recording a video, dit it again in one take and it's still quite far from the quality I'd like these videos to have but I'd say it's passable. Still a bit of a struggle to talk to no one. :/

Sources / More reading (still no hyperlinks): 
- The Deep Learning book by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courtville, 2016. All available online so I recommend reading just the introduction, it's not too long and fairly accessible. www.deeplearningbook.org
- The report on Foundation Models by a Stanford group, 2022. Long report so I recommend just the intro, but you can take a look at the table of contents and pick and choose some other parts to read as well (like 3. Applications and 5. Society). https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258
